This workshop introduces you to the [Kratix](https://www.kratix.io) framework. We have created a series of tutorials that build up your understanding of what Kratix is, how Kratix works, and how you can use Kratix to deliver a first-class platform to your organisation. 

Before beginning this workshop, consider your answers to the following questions:

* What's the highest value service your platform provides to your application development teams? 
* How easy is it for you to provide and maintain that service?
* How easy is it for application developers to use that service?
* What are the possible opportunities available to you to enable your application developers better flow at a lower cost to you and your platform team?
