# What's next?

Our last hands-on session went through how to [enhance a Kratix Promise](/enhancing-a-promise/README.md). 

Thinking back to the questions at the start of the tutorial, you are the best person to decide what is most valuable to continue exploration in Kratix. 

In your context, what were the answers to these questions:

* What is the highest value service your platform provides to your application development teams? 
* How easy is it for you to provide and maintain that service?
* How easy is it for application developers to use that service?
* How can you enhance flow for your application developers and reduce effort for you and your platform team?

## Opportunities

### Configuring your platform offerings with business requirements

We saw that Postgres could be configured to identify cost centres. Perhaps you have more complex billing scenarios. Or perhaps there are quotas associated with your platform's offerings. 

Imagine customising the pipeline for one of your services, like we did with Postgres, so that it:
* sends a request to an external API to validate the user sending the request has permission to bill that particular cost centre.
* verifies any quotas that may have been setup and sends an email to inform interested parties.

### Securing your platform
As an enhancement to our Postgres Promise, we added validations that are executed when a new resource request is received by the platform cluster. 

Imagine customising your platform to have more rigorous validation so that it:
* has robust validations for resource requests coming to production environments&mdash;for example, only specific values are accepted in the request. A list of possible validations can be found [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#schemaObject).

### Optimising your platform

It's easy to imagine improvements to your service request pipeline and pipeline assets to make the platform more consistent and extensible.

Imagine customising the pipeline for one of your services, like we did with Postgres, so that it:
* has reusable logic in all the Promises you publish in your platform. Instead of editing the script being executed by the `postgres-request-pipeline` image, you could move logic from each step into its own dedicated image and just add these images to the `xaasRequestPipeline`. 

### Designing the right platform for your users
Core to designing the right platform in a platform team is understanding your users and what they need&mdash;you need to treat your platform as a product. 

Imagine discovering that four application teams all use the same database but each team has different backup strategies, different levels of monitoring and different ways of seeing what's happening on the database. 

With Kratix, you can easily design this database as an offering on your platform, and your service request pipeline defines that service so that every database includes the paved path backup strategy, monitoring dashboard, and UI client. 

If the idea of treating your platform as a product is new concept to you, watch this short talk by [Paula Kennedy](https://twitter.com/PaulaLKennedy) at Devoxx UK: [Crossing the Platform Gap](https://youtu.be/pAk5GReIs90).
