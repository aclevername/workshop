### In this tutorial, you will
* [learn more about Kratix as a framework](#what-is-kratix)

Kratix is a framework used by platform teams to build the custom platforms tailored to their organisation.

### Using Kratix to build your platform you can:

* use GitOps workflow and familiar Kubernetes-native constructs.
* co-create capabilities by providing a clear contract between application and platform teams through the definition and creation of ‚ÄúPromises‚Äù. We'll talk more about Kratix Promises in [the next step](/installing-a-promise/README.md).
* create a flexible platform with your paved paths as Promises.
* evolve your platform easily as your business needs change. 
* start small on a laptop and expand to multi-team, multi-cluster, multi-region, and multi-cloud with a consistent API everywhere.

### Providing a Kratix-built platform allows your users to:
- discover available services that are already fit-for-purpose.
- consume services on demand using standard Kubernetes APIs.
- move focus away from infrastructure toward adding product value.

Now that you know more about Kratix, follow the steps below to install Kratix locally.

## <a name="install-kratix"></a> Quick Start: Install a multi-cluster Kratix using KinD

![Overview](../assets/images/Treasure_Trove-Install_Kratix.jpg)

### Steps
1. [Complete pre-requistes](#prerequisites), if required
1. [Delete existing clusters](#delete-clusters), if required
1. [Clone Kratix](#clone-kratix)
1. [Set up your `platform` cluster](#platform-setup)
1. [Adjust networking for KinD](#kind-networking), if required
1. [Set up your `worker` cluster](#worker-setup)
1. [Verify installation](#verify-installation), if required


### <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
1. **Kubernetes-in-Docker(KinD)**: <br/>
  See [the quick start guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to install.

1. **kubectl**: see [the install guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

1. A **Docker Hub account** with push permissions.

1. Be logged into **[Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to build and push images: see [login docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)

1. In order to complete all tutorials in this series, you must allocate enough resources to Docker. Docker requires:<br><br>
5 CPU<br>
12GB Memory<br>
4GB swap<br><br>
This can be managed through your tool of choice (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher, etc).

###  <a name="delete-clusters"></a>Delete existing clusters

If you've already installed KinD, ensure no clusters are currently running.

```bash
kind get clusters
```


The above command will give an output similar to
```console
No kind clusters found.
```

If you have any named `platform` or `worker` please delete them with
```bash
kind delete clusters platform worker
```
<br>

####  <a name="clone-kratix"></a>Clone Kratix
```bash
git clone https://github.com/syntasso/kratix.git
cd kratix
```

### <a name="platform-setup"></a>Set up your `platform` cluster

Create your `platform` cluster and install Kratix.

```bash
kind create cluster --name platform
kubectl apply --filename distribution/kratix.yaml
kubectl apply --filename hack/platform/minio-install.yaml
```

The Kratix API is now available.

```bash
kubectl get crds
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                   CREATED AT
clusters.platform.kratix.io            2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
promises.platform.kratix.io            2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
workplacements.platform.kratix.io      2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
works.platform.kratix.io               2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
```

### <a name="kind-networking"></a>Adjust multi-cluster networking for KinD
Some KinD installations use non-standard networking. To ensure cross-cluster communication you need to run this script:

```bash
PLATFORM_CLUSTER_IP=`docker inspect platform-control-plane | grep '"IPAddress": "172' | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F '"' '{print $2}'`
sed -i'' -e "s/172.18.0.2/$PLATFORM_CLUSTER_IP/g" hack/worker/gitops-tk-resources.yaml
```

### <a name="worker-setup"></a>Set up your `worker` cluster
Create your `worker` cluster. This will create a cluster for running the X-as-a-service workloads:

```bash
kind create cluster --name worker #Also switches kubectl context to worker
kubectl apply --filename config/samples/platform_v1alpha1_worker_cluster.yaml --context kind-platform #register the worker cluster with the platform cluster
kubectl apply --filename hack/worker/gitops-tk-install.yaml
kubectl apply --filename hack/worker/gitops-tk-resources.yaml
```

Once Flux is installed and running (this may take a few minutes so `--watch` will append updates to the bottom of the output), the Kratix resources will be visible on the worker cluster.

```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker get namespaces --watch
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
kratix-worker-system   Active   1m
```

### <a name="verify-installation"></a>Verify installation

Not sure if you are properly set up? The list of commands below will validate whether your installation was successful

_To verify your have the two necessary clusters_

```bash
kind get clusters
```

You should see something similar to
```console
platform
worker
```
<br/>

_To verify Kratix and MinIO are installed and healthy_

```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform get pods --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager-769855f9bb-8srtj   2/2     Running      0          1h
minio-6f75d9fbcf-5cn7w                                1/1     Running      0          1h
```
<br/>

_To verify the Kratix API is available_

```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform get crds
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                   CREATED AT
clusters.platform.kratix.io            2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
promises.platform.kratix.io            2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
workplacements.platform.kratix.io      2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
works.platform.kratix.io               2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
```
<br/>

_To verify Flux is installed and configured (i.e., Flux knows where in MinIO to look for resources to install)_

```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker get buckets.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io --namespace flux-system
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                        URL   READY   STATUS                                                       AGE
kratix-workload-crds              True    Fetched revision: 9343bf26ec16db995d7b53ff63c64b7dfb9789c4   1m
kratix-workload-resources         True    Fetched revision: f2d918e21d4c5cc65791d121f4a3375ad80a3eac   1m
```
<br/>

_To verify you can deploy resources to the worker, check if your "canary" resource has been deployed_

```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker get namespaces kratix-worker-system
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
kratix-worker-system   Active   1h
```
